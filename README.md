## Github Api Interface

### To start your project you need to download the required dependencies, you can do it with npm or yarn 
### typing `npm install` or `yarn install` inside the folder that contains the package.json & package-lock.json 

### After installing the required dependencies you can run this project with `npm start` or `yarn start`
### If the command doesn't open a new tab in your browser you can access it on `localhost:3000` 

### This project was made using benits's https://github.com/benits/github-api-interface repository,
